## JTalks spam classification 

To open it, use the IPython notebook viewer: [javatalks.ru spam classification](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jtalks-org/jtalks-analytics/blob/master/spam-classification.ipynb)

If you want to run the code yourself, you will need to download the file and put it into your IPython Notebook folder. Of course, you will need [IPython](http://ipython.org/) to do this.
